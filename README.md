# Bikeshare-Motivate

In this project, I focused on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page to freely download the trip data.:

- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)
- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

To inform business decisions, I explored:
- The duration of trip distribution for both subsribers and customers to determine the cut-off duration (currently it is the 30-minute mark)
- The usage of customers throughout the days and months and seasonality to make inventory and pricing decisions
- The usage of customers in pick up and return locations to make inventory and strategy decisions
- Users' demographics
- How far customers go using the bikes

To inform customer decisions, I explored:
- The popular pick up and return locations
- The opimal duration to use the bikes
- What day or what month or what season they would want to use the bikes
